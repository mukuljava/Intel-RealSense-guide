# Intel-RealSense-guide
A guide to get start with Intel RealSense camera and SDK in C++ and MATLAB. Worked on Intel RealSense Camera to get the depth value and the RGB data of an image streaming through the camera in MATLAB. The project involved aligning of the Depth image and RGB image and built user interfaced slider to differentiate between the depth and RGB image.
